# Joel's Personal Website

How to get started:

1. Install [LTS Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

1. Install pnpm and nuxi globally: `npm i -g pnpm nuxi`

1. Clone the [site's repository](https://github.com/JoelYoung01/PersonalWebsite) to your machine

1. (If using VSCode, which is ideal) Install the recommended extensions and enable [takeover mode](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#volar-takeover-mode)

1. At the the root of the project, run `pnpm i` to install dependencies

1. Run `nuxi dev` to start the site! If everything worked correctly, it should be hosting [here](http://localhost:3000)
